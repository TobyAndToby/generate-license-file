title: Migrate from V2 to V3

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

## Breaking Changes

### Improved Output Content

Between v2 and v3 we've re-written our core license-finding logic to be more accurate;
this means that your outputted file content has probably changed, but don't worry, it'll now contain more precise information.

### Specifying Line Endings

In v2, when using the library programmatically, you could specify the line ending to use in the output as the last parameter.

In v3, there are now more options you can pass in so the line ending option has moved into an options object along with the new options.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="programmatic" label="Programmatic use">

```ts
// diff-red
await generateLicenseFile(myInput, myOutput, "lf");
// diff-green
await generateLicenseFile(myInput, myOutput, { lineEnding: "lf" });

// diff-red
await getLicenseFileText(myInput, "lf");
// diff-green
await getLicenseFileText(myInput, { lineEnding: "lf" });

// diff-red
await getProjectLicenses(myInput, "lf");
// diff-green
await getProjectLicenses(myInput, { lineEnding: "lf" });
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Warnings in the Console

In v3, Generate License File will now log warnings in particular scenarios. While you don't _need_ to fix them, we suggest that you do so that
your output is as accurate as possible. Such scenarios include:

- Being unable to find a license for a package
- Finding multiple licenses for a package

:::info Actions Required
Check your console output for warnings and fix them if you can.

## New Features to Consider

### Config Files

The v3 implementation is more flexible and allows those who use our CLI to have greater control over what it produces,
so if you find you're unhappy with what it's producing for a particular package then see our page on <a href="./cli/config-file">using a config file</a>.

In summary, you can now:

- Exclude packages from the output
- Replace the license for a package
- Append additional text to the generated output

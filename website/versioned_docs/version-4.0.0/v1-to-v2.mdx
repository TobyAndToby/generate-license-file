## Breaking Changes

### Output file format

Between the major versions we've made a few small formatting changes to the outputted file content.

#### Line Endings

In v1, generate-license-file preserved the line endings _within_ license text. The `--eol` property only applied to the text added around the licenses.

In v2, the `--eol` property applies to all text in the output to create a consistent file.

#### Capitalisation of npm

In v1, the output text wrote "npm" in capital letters.

In v2, the output now [correctly](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.0.0#:~:text=npm%20will%20now%20scold%20you%20if%20you%20capitalize%20its%20name.%20seriously%20it%20will%20fight%20you.) writes npm in lowercase.

#### Credit

In v1, credit to generate-license-file was only put at the bottom of the file.

In v2, credit is now also added at the top of the file.

### End-of-line flag (EOL)

In v1, the `eol` arguement took in either `windows` or `posix` to set the line ending values in the output to either `\r\n` or `\n` respectively.

In v2, the `eol` arguement now takes either `crlf` or `lf` for either `\r\n` or `\n` respectively.

### Input

In v1, the `input` parameter was a path to the directory containing the `package.json` file.

In v2, the `input` parameter needs to be a path to the `package.json` file itself.

## New features to consider

### CI Mode

If you're running the generate-license-file CLI as a part of your CI/CD pipelines/processes then you'll probably want to include our new `--ci` flag.

This flag ensures that the CLI fails with a non-zero exitcode whenever it would normally prompt the user for an input.
This can stop your processes from needlessly hanging until they hit your configured timeout,
saving you time as well as debug effort due to the messages it will log before it exits.
